<h3>Life</h3>
<img src="images/fish.png" id="pic1">
<p>My name is Wesley Sirinian and <span class="highlight">I am a 16 year old junior at CCA </span>. I live in San Diego with my mom and dad and have a sister who’s a freshman at SDSU. I have a dog named Lucy and I used to have <a href="https://www.aqueon.com/articles/ways-to-know-your-fish-are-happy" target="_blank">fish </a>for about 5 years until they died. I’m about 5’9 and I weigh 140lbs. My mom is Vietnamese and my dad is from Chicago so I’m half and half. I have an aunt and cousin that also live in California as well.

<h3>Free Time</h3>

<p>In my free time, one of my favorite hobbies is playing video games and golfing. I play Fortnite and R6 sometimes but I mainly play clash royale during the week. I have 15k and <span class="highlight">my favorite card is hog rider </span>and my least favorite is <a href="https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Elixir_Golem" target="_blank">e-golem </a>because it’s no skill. I also play competitive golf outside of school as a play almost everyday. I played for the school varsity team for the past two years and play tournaments outside of that regularly. I used to play travel baseball but I don’t anymore.

<h3>Interests</h3>

<p>Some other things about me is that my favorite food is <span class="highlight">chicken nuggets (dino edition) </span>and popsicles. I don’t watch sports that much but I liked the cubs for a while when I used to play baseball. My favorite golfer is Jordan Spieth and even though he's 10 years out of his prime, I still like him. My favorite basketball player is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/LeBron-James" target="_blank">Lebron James </a>because he’s the glorious king. My favorite song is The Largest by bigxthaplug because he’s the biggest.
